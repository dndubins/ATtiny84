For battery-powered applications, it might be important to let the user know if the batteries are getting low. Or, if you are reporting sensor values, they might get corrupted as the battery voltage drops. Even internal reference voltages are affected by the battery voltage. battLife84.ino reports a percent battery life for the ATtiny84 chip (0-100%) to the user, assuming 3.2V is full and 2.0V is empty.
