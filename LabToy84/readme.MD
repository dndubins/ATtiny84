# ATtiny84 Lab Toy

This fun project was my attempt at making a minimalist timer/stopwatch for collecting data points in my pharmaceutics labs. Many labs (e.g. USP dissolution) require the timed collection of samples. Every year, small battery-powered timers are somewhat of a consumable, both in terms of the batteries, and the timers themselves.

What I really wanted was a small, energy efficient timer/stopwatch that was easy to program and use. Then the upgrades started. I added:
 - a clock mode, to keep track of the time
 - an alarm mode, to beep at a specific time of day (with silence feature)
 - a stopwatch mode
 - a temperature mode, by calibrating the onboard core temperature sensor on the ATtiny84
