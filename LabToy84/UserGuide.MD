# User Guide for the LabToy84
  
- There are two momentary switches on this device: a MODE button (called sw2 in the program) and a SET button (called sw1 in the program).
- The program distinguishes between a short push (<=0.5 sec) and a long push (>0.5 sec) on each button.

## To Change Modes: 
- Pressing the MODE button (short push) will cycle between the following modes: <b>Clock --> Temperature --> Timer --> Stopwatch</b>.
- Pressing the MODE button (long push) will allow you to set the brightness of the LED 4-digit 7-segment display from (0-7), where 0: dimmest, 7: brightest.
- A short push on SET cycles between the options 0-7 then OFF.
- Pressing the MODE button accepts the current option displayed on the screen.
- "OFF" is a battery saving mode, where the LED display will use a brightness of 3, but only light up momentarily when you press a button. This prolongs battery life and would also be useful if the dimmest setting of the screen is keeping you awake at night.

The method described here to set a number is true for the rest of the options in general: a short SET button push cycles the options, and the MODE button accepts the current option displayed. For setting the time or date, a long push decreases the displayed number.
  
## To Set The Clock and Alarm:
   - While in Clock mode, a long push on the SET button enters "set all" mode.
   - Use the SET button for each push below: (short push to advance number, long push to accept)
   - increase HRS with short push, decrease with long push, accept with MODE button (screen will prompt with am and pm);
   - increase MIN with short push, decrease with long push, accept with MODE button;
   - increase DAY with short push, decrease with long push, accept with MODE button;
   - increase MONTH with short push, decrease with long push, accept with MODE button;
   - set ALARM on/off with short push, accept with MODE button.
   - if ALARM on:
      - increase ALARM HRS with short push, decrease with long push, accept with MODE button;
      - increase ALARM MIN with short push, decrease with long push, accept with MODE button.
   **Note:** The alarm will only sound while the device is in Clock mode (displaying the time).

### To Snooze or Silence Clock Alarm:
   - While the ALARM is ringing:
      - The MODE button will silence the alarm for the day. Alarm mode stays ON (will ring the next day). 
      - The SET button is a 5-minute snooze bar. You can keep pressing the SET button to sound the alarm 5 minutes later.
   - If you allow the alarm to keep ringing without pressing the MODE or SET button, the ALARM will silence itself after 20 seconds. Alarm mode will stay on, and ring the next day.

### Brightness Menu: to Set LED brightness, and to Disable Clock Mode
Setting the brightness lower will save battery life.
Setting the clock mode to "OFF" will put the microprocessor to sleep when not using the other modes. This will also save battery life.

   - A long push on the MODE button enters "set brightness and LED on/off" menu. This menu is accessible from Clock and Timer modes.  
   - Set LED BRIGHTNESS with short push (SET button), accept with MODE button.
   - Options: 0(most dim) to 7 (most bright), then OFF
   - OFF option keeps LED off unless a button is pushed (battery saving).
   - Set CLOCK on/off with short push, accept with MODE button.
   - BATT status will display (in %). If using USB, this will just display 100%.

## Temperature Mode
  - Temperature will report every 5 seconds.
  - To leave this mode, press the MODE button.
  - The SET button does nothing here.

## Timer Mode
  - "PUSH" will be displayed on the LED screen.
  - To start the timer, add time by pressing the SET button.
  - Each time you press the SET button, more time is added (+1 min increments, then as you keep pressing, the increments increase). 
  - The timer will automatically start when you let go.
  - You can add time by pressing the SET button at any time while the timer is counting down.
  - The timer will ring, and reset when the time is up.
  - If you would like to silence the timer alarm while it is ringing, press any button.
  - To reset the timer, hold down the SET button (long push), or press the MODE button to change modes.
  - The timer will not continue if you change modes. You need to stay in the Timer mode to use the timer.

## Stopwatch Mode
  - "00" will be displayed on the LED screen.
  - To start the stopwatch, short press the SET button.
  - To pause/continue the stopwatch, short press the SET button.
  - To reset the stopwatch, long press the SET button.
  - Brightness menu cannot be accessed from this mode.
