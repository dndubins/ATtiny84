I accidentally allocated 3 non-PWM pins (pins PA2, PA3, PA4) for the ATtiny84 to control 3 servos. This involved a PCB print, so rather than swap pins around, I wanted to create a "brute force" sketch that would control the servos independently or simultaneously. Here it is! No special library required. This sketch could easily be adapted to other MCUs by modifying the PORT bank and pin numbers.
